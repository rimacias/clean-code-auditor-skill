# Introduce Null Object

### Problem

Since some methods return `null` instead of real objects, you have many checks for `null` in your code.

### Solution

Instead of `null`, return a null object that exhibits the default behavior.

Before

```
if (customer == null) {
  plan = BillingPlan.basic();
}
else {
  plan = customer.getPlan();
}
```

After

```
class NullCustomer extends Customer {
  boolean isNull() {
    return true;
  }
  Plan getPlan() {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
customer = (order.customer != null) ?
  order.customer : new NullCustomer();

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.getPlan();
```

Before

```
if (customer == null) 
{
  plan = BillingPlan.Basic();
}
else 
{
  plan = customer.GetPlan();
}
```

After

```
public sealed class NullCustomer: Customer 
{
  public override bool IsNull 
  {
    get { return true; }
  }
  
  public override Plan GetPlan() 
  {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
customer = order.customer ?? new NullCustomer();

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.GetPlan();
```

Before

```
if ($customer === null) {
  $plan = BillingPlan::basic();
} else {
  $plan = $customer->getPlan();
}
```

After

```
class NullCustomer extends Customer {
  public function isNull() {
    return true;
  }
  public function getPlan() {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
$customer = ($order->customer !== null) ?
  $order->customer :
  new NullCustomer;

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
$plan = $customer->getPlan();
```

Before

```
if customer is None:
    plan = BillingPlan.basic()
else:
    plan = customer.getPlan()
```

After

```
class NullCustomer(Customer):

    def isNull(self):
        return True

    def getPlan(self):
        return self.NullPlan()

    # Some other NULL functionality.

# Replace null values with Null-object.
customer = order.customer or NullCustomer()

# Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.getPlan()
```

Before

```
if (customer == null) {
  plan = BillingPlan.basic();
}
else {
  plan = customer.getPlan();
}
```

After

```
class NullCustomer extends Customer {
  isNull(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
  getPlan(): Plan {
    return new NullPlan();
  }
  // Some other NULL functionality.
}

// Replace null values with Null-object.
let customer = (order.customer != null) ?
  order.customer : new NullCustomer();

// Use Null-object as if it's normal subclass.
plan = customer.getPlan();
```

### Why Refactor

Dozens of checks for `null` make your code longer and uglier.

### Drawbacks

* The price of getting rid of conditionals is creating yet another new class.

### How to Refactor

1. From the class in question, create a subclass that will perform the role of null object.
2. In both classes, create the method `isNull()`, which will return `true` for a null object and `false` for a real class.
3. Find all places where the code may return `null` instead of a real object. Change the code so that it returns a null object.
4. Find all places where the variables of the real class are compared with `null`. Replace these checks with a call for `isNull()`.
5. * If methods of the original class are run in these conditionals when a value doesn’t equal `null`, redefine these methods in the null class and insert the code from the `else` part of the condition there. Then you can delete the entire conditional and differing behavior will be implemented via polymorphism.
   * If things aren’t so simple and the methods can’t be redefined, see if you can simply extract the operators that were supposed to be performed in the case of a `null` value to new methods of the null object. Call these methods instead of the old code in `else` as the operations by default.
