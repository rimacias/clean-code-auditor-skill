# Replace Error Code with Exception

### Problem

A method returns a special value that indicates an error?

### Solution

Throw an exception instead.

Before

```
int withdraw(int amount) {
  if (amount > _balance) {
    return -1;
  }
  else {
    balance -= amount;
    return 0;
  }
}
```

After

```
void withdraw(int amount) throws BalanceException {
  if (amount > _balance) {
    throw new BalanceException();
  }
  balance -= amount;
}
```

Before

```
int Withdraw(int amount) 
{
  if (amount > _balance) 
  {
    return -1;
  }
  else 
  {
    balance -= amount;
    return 0;
  }
}
```

After

```
///<exception cref="BalanceException">Thrown when amount > _balance</exception>
void Withdraw(int amount)
{
  if (amount > _balance) 
  {
    throw new BalanceException();
  }
  balance -= amount;
}
```

Before

```
function withdraw($amount) {
  if ($amount > $this->balance) {
    return -1;
  } else {
    $this->balance -= $amount;
    return 0;
  }
}
```

After

```
function withdraw($amount) {
  if ($amount > $this->balance) {
    throw new BalanceException;
  }
  $this->balance -= $amount;
}
```

Before

```
def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > self.balance:
        return -1
    else:
        self.balance -= amount
    return 0
```

After

```
def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > self.balance:
        raise BalanceException()
    self.balance -= amount
```

Before

```
withdraw(amount: number): number {
  if (amount > _balance) {
    return -1;
  }
  else {
    balance -= amount;
    return 0;
  }
}
```

After

```
withdraw(amount: number): void {
  if (amount > _balance) {
    throw new Error();
  }
  balance -= amount;
}
```

### Why Refactor

Returning error codes is an obsolete holdover from procedural programming. In modern programming, error handling is performed by special classes, which are named exceptions. If a problem occurs, you “throw” an error, which is then “caught” by one of the exception handlers. Special error-handling code, which is ignored in normal conditions, is activated to respond.

### Benefits

* Frees code from a large number of conditionals for checking various error codes. Exception handlers are a much more succinct way to differentiate normal execution paths from abnormal ones.
* Exception classes can implement their own methods, thus containing part of the error handling functionality (such as for sending error messages).
* Unlike exceptions, error codes can’t be used in a constructor, since a constructor must return only a new object.

### Drawbacks

* An exception handler can turn into a goto-like crutch. Avoid this! Don’t use exceptions to manage code execution. Exceptions should be thrown only to inform of an error or critical situation.

### How to Refactor

Try to perform these refactoring steps for only one error code at a time. This will make it easier to keep all the important information in your head and avoid errors.

1. Find all calls to a method that returns error codes and, instead of checking for an error code, wrap it in `try`/`catch` blocks.
2. Inside the method, instead of returning an error code, throw an exception.
3. Change the method signature so that it contains information about the exception being thrown (`@throws` section).
