# Simplifying Method Calls

These techniques make method calls simpler and easier to understand. This, in turn, simplifies the interfaces for interaction between classes.

[Rename Method](https://refactoring.guru/rename-method)

**Problem:** The name of a method doesn’t explain what the method does.

**Solution:** Rename the method.

[Add Parameter](https://refactoring.guru/add-parameter)

**Problem:** A method doesn’t have enough data to perform certain actions.

**Solution:** Create a new parameter to pass the necessary data.

[Remove Parameter](https://refactoring.guru/remove-parameter)

**Problem:** A parameter isn’t used in the body of a method.

**Solution:** Remove the unused parameter.

[Separate Query from Modifier](https://refactoring.guru/separate-query-from-modifier)

**Problem:** Do you have a method that returns a value but also changes something inside an object?

**Solution:** Split the method into two separate methods. As you would expect, one of them should return the value and the other one modifies the object.

[Parameterize Method](https://refactoring.guru/parameterize-method)

**Problem:** Multiple methods perform similar actions that are different only in their internal values, numbers or operations.

**Solution:** Combine these methods by using a parameter that will pass the necessary special value.

[Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods](https://refactoring.guru/replace-parameter-with-explicit-methods)

**Problem:** A method is split into parts, each of which is run depending on the value of a parameter.

**Solution:** Extract the individual parts of the method into their own methods and call them instead of the original method.

[Preserve Whole Object](https://refactoring.guru/preserve-whole-object)

**Problem:** You get several values from an object and then pass them as parameters to a method.

**Solution:** Instead, try passing the whole object.

[Replace Parameter with Method Call](https://refactoring.guru/replace-parameter-with-method-call)

**Problem:** Calling a query method and passing its results as the parameters of another method, while that method could call the query directly.

**Solution:** Instead of passing the value through a parameter, try placing a query call inside the method body.

[Introduce Parameter Object](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-parameter-object)

**Problem:** Your methods contain a repeating group of parameters.

**Solution:** Replace these parameters with an object.

[Remove Setting Method](https://refactoring.guru/remove-setting-method)

**Problem:** The value of a field should be set only when it’s created, and not change at any time after that.

**Solution:** So remove methods that set the field’s value.

[Hide Method](https://refactoring.guru/hide-method)

**Problem:** A method isn’t used by other classes or is used only inside its own class hierarchy.

**Solution:** Make the method private or protected.

[Replace Constructor with Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/replace-constructor-with-factory-method)

**Problem:** You have a complex constructor that does something more than just setting parameter values in object fields.

**Solution:** Create a factory method and use it to replace constructor calls.

[Replace Error Code with Exception](https://refactoring.guru/replace-error-code-with-exception)

**Problem:** A method returns a special value that indicates an error?

**Solution:** Throw an exception instead.

[Replace Exception with Test](https://refactoring.guru/replace-exception-with-test)

**Problem:** You throw an exception in a place where a simple test would do the job?

**Solution:** Replace the exception with a condition test.
